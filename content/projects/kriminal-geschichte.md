## Kriminal Geschichte, a murder party with a video game Twist

{{< figure src="/images/kg/button.png" caption="*The button used by players*" class="left" >}}

In April of 2021, a friend of mine that wants to work as a game designer came to
me to ask if wwe could create a video game for a murder party of his making that
was going to take place a few months later.

The idea was that each player would have their own character in the game, with a
sprite, and that we could play "Non stop debates" (a game mechanic inspired from
the video game Dongaronpa), where each player could interact with the game using
a physical button they would have in front of them.

And of course, there had to be an interface for the game master, where they
could select which "Non stop debate" to play, and add or remove Health Points to
the players.

We got to work and in two month, we had a product ready for the big night!

I used Unity to create the video game, and created an interface that my
friend (who is not a developper) could use to create the scripts for the "Non
stop debates". I decided to add a rythm game that the players could play at the
end of the murder party, once they had solved the enigma.

For this project, I had to learn advanced Unity features to display a different
scene on each screen, and for the rythm game.

Only problem, we had not met in real life to setup the hardware, and everything
had to be installed the day of the party, in a rush.

The result was far from perfect, but still a great result, and a ton of fun.
I learned a lot along the way.

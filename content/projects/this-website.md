## Making this website taught me so much about the web

I had to create a website (more on that later in the article), host it with a
small server on [Linode](https://linode.com) and buy a domain name on
[Ovh](https://ovh.com).

It was a whole adventure, I improved my knowledge on linux administration, ssh,
and especially web development.

### The website

The website is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static website generator,
which allows me to write the content of my website using Markdown, which I'm
very comfortable with.

Although I am using a theme ([Hermit theme](https://github.com/Track3/hermit)),
I heavily modified it to fit my purpose, using html, css, and javascript.

The whole challenge was to allow the website to still be edited in markdown.

### The hosting

My server is hosted on a *"Nanode"*, a VPS provided by
[Linode](https://linode.com).

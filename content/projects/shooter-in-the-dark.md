## Shooter in the dark, my first video game

> [You can play the game on itch.io!](https://sweetiemetalhead.itch.io/shooter-in-the-dark)

I want to make games, and the best way to learn is to do. So I decided to take
the first "game-jam-worthy" topic that crossed my mind (in this case, it was
*"blinded by the light"*) and got to work.

The idea of the game is that you are in the center of a room with four doors,
there are ~~spheres~~ zombies are coming out of them regularly, and you have to
shoot them. But as you progress, the lights turn off, and you have to rely on
your flashlight to see them. Once you reach the last level, even your flashlight
turns off and you have to rely on the sound the doors make.

Some zombies drop flares, which you can use to light up an area for a limited
time.

I made Shooter in the dark in 3 days, and uploaded it to
[itch.io](https://itch.io) with the only goal to remember I had made it.

There are achievements, a main menu, and music that I made myself using
[Bosca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net/), a cool little software to make 8-bit
music!

The game has *a lot* of defects: It is way too hard, it relies heavily on sound
so it's not inclusive to hearing-impared people, it is *ugly as hell*.
But it taught me the basics of Unity, and it is still fun playing it!

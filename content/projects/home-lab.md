## My home lab, or how to learn Docker the fun way

At some point in the near past, I realised that learning Docker for the sake of
knowing how to use it was not motivating enough, so I decided to recycle an old
pc I had lying around that wasn't used and turn it into a home lab,
powered by docker of course.

It runs Debian, and has a few useful services:
- An [Invidious instance](https://invidious.io/)
- A Torrent client (This is only used to learn how to route a docker
container through a vpn connection, I do not download any copyrighted material)

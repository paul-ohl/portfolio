## Welcome to my corner of the web

Hi!

{{< figure class="right" src="/images/paul-ohl.jpeg" caption="The picture was taken by **[Rachel Rottier](https://www.instagram.com/rottier_rachel/)**." >}}

My name is Paul and I like to build software. It all started when I learned the
basics of logic gates to make cool Minecraft contraptions, and my interest in
building fun and useful 'robots' never stopped growing.

But I am also a musician. I love to play Bass, and I'm learning how to
use [Ableton](https://ableton.com/), a powerful Digital Audio Workstation.

And because I want to keep a healthy mind in a healthy body, I have made
exercising a big part of my life. I practice calisthenics and bouldering on a
very regular basis.

I took a web developer course at
[OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/555-web-developer)
and I am currently a student at the highly renowned [Ã©cole 42](https://42.fr/)
in Paris, France.
